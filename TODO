Priority:
    Cross-Platform
    Reference count for Option. To save space.
    SIGTTIN when debugging the debugger and debuggee reads from stdin
Sandbox
    Breakpoint for new thread
    Logging system
    Interactive
    Interface for fuzzing framework like sulley, strike
    Pattern Match, Return value capture for Man in the Middle
    Sub process must be able to passed into arguments. Especially for Unix like
    Anti-Reversing for sandox. Avoid being analysed by other hackers.
Emulator
Monitor
    Check Alive
Bomber
Entropy character
    Gray-box fuzzing, a ranking factor for genetic algorithm( Not for now, before thoroughly understand fuzzing )

Allow for multiple costomizing hanlers, through config file
Locating the issue causing false IAT. Why so many false IAT?
Exception
Command Options(-n for times, -d disable, -p process(handling params), -l log, -c crash_report)
Distinguish functions with the same name in different libraries

Wrong to assume breakpoint at next instruction will be executed immediately, concerning threads. Anything like last_dyn will be invalid.
